# DevOpsKube

A Kubernetes "cluster" with all things SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)/DevOps related.

## Motivation

It was/is the dream of the team to be able to install such a stack easily on own Hardware and/or environment. Kubernetes seems like the natural choice for this.

Up until now there is no full DevOps Stack for vanilla Kubernetes. The following "solutions" can be found when googling:

* [fabric8](http://fabric8.io/) - probably the closest to our requirements, and we already talk about some interaction between the two projects
* [Harbur](https://github.com/harbur/docker-sdlc) - mainly focused on docker and has no real kubernetes support
* [Software Factory](http://softwarefactory-project.io/) - from RedHat as well, based on OpenStack
* [Marcel Birkner](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/10/continuous-integration-platform-using-docker-container-jenkins-sonarqube-nexus-gitlab/) - a blog-post from codecentric (merely an blog-post with some docker containers)
* [GoPaddle](https://www.gopaddle.io/#/) - seems to be focused on a full CI Environment to install Container on Kubernetes and uses eg. Jenkins, but is commercial and has a different focus then the above mentioned ones

None of the above mentioned stacks do fulfill our needs, therefor we decided to put this stack together to allow you to install a full SDLC stack on your own Kubernetes cluster.

In the last year, a new project [jenkins-x](https://jenkins-x.io) appeared on the market. This is a project founded by some guys which worked already 
on fabric8. This project provides a full solution to setup and implements a cloud CI/CD workflow using tools, which are used in DevopsKube as well. Our
focus is still slightly different, in that we do not focus on providing a workflow for a cloud only environment, but to provide a solution to setup a SDLC 
stack for small to midsize teams rather easy.

## Components

The following components are included in the current version:

* [Redmine](components/redmine) - Project Management/Issue Tracking
* [Jenkins](components/jenkins) - Automation Server for CI and CD stuff
* [TheNexus](components/nexus) - Central Repository for Maven/Gradle/...
* [SonarQube](components/sonarqube) - Platform to manage code quality
* [Gogs](components/gogs) - central Git Repository
* [Keycloak](components/keycloak) - central authentication server

To provide central data-storeage options we are using [MySql](components/mysql) for all components in need of a database.

## Helper

Since a vanilla Kubernetes Cluster does not provide any Edge-Loadbalancer or an SSO-Component, we are going to provide documentation on how to setup the whole cluster including an Edge-Loadbalancer and other useful tools (eg. SSO Components). An initial set of Helpers are:

* [Nginx Ingress](components/nginx-ingress) - Load-Balancing for Kubernetes PODs
* [Kube-Lego](components/kube-lego) - Kube-Lego automatically requests certificates for Kubernetes Ingress resources from Let's Encrypt

For the use of a configurable set of PODs, we are using [helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm) in its latest (not yet ready for production) incarnation (> 2.0.0-alpha5).
