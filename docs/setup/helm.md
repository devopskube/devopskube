# Setup Helm

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. helm is still in its infancy and not production ready, documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm).

helm can now downloaded from the above mentioned page and installed using the described method in the [install](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md) document.

We do use version 2.0.0-alpha5 of helm, so make sure, that you are using the same or a later version.
